# Rock_Paper_Scissors_Project

## *stanCode* Projects
Hello there! I'm Calvin.\

This project is a real-time rock-paper-scissor game that players can play against computer. We apply neural networks and train the model with our gesture. The computer will be able to sense the hand gesture of a player. As the player posing one of the three gestures in a specific region, the screen simultaneously shows its choice and tells who wins.
